# General
A detailed description of the Java code of EVER II can be found in the file "Handbuch_Code_EVERII". There the individual classes are considered and discussed in detail. The file is updated and supplemented with each change.

# WorkflowAbstraction
It is a project to extract, generalize and abstract workflows from an ontology of BPMN workflows for the final purpose of transferring procedural knowledge between two domains.

Codes can run in java 8 environment

Codes have been created in the 4.16 release of the Eclipse Project which is developed on Java SE 8 VMs. As such, the Eclipse SDK as a whole is targeted at all modern, desktop Java VMs.

# Visualizing abstracted workflows by using graphviz - java 
https://github.com/nidi3/graphviz-java.git

#Open issues:
- Similarity measures for sentences based on Word similarity given by Word2Vec model (Word2Vec model has been migrated from the python project to java)

# Running codes
Under the folder everII/src/main/java/Main you can find the following two runnable java class:
EmpiricalExperiment.java
TransferProcess.java
